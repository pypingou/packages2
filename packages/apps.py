Python includes modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac and MFC). Programmers can write new built-in modules for Python in C or C++. Python can be used as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Note that documentation for Python is provided in the python-docs package. This package provides the "python" executable; most of the actual implementation is within the "python-libs" package.',
